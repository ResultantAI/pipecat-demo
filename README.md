TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript
- No external dependencies (except web-safe fonts)
- Clean, commented code
- Smooth animations (use CSS transitions and keyframes)
- Proper state management in JavaScript
- Mobile responsive (test down to 375px width)
- Professional hover effects on buttons
- Accessible (proper contrast ratios, semantic HTML)

VISUAL POLISH:
- Box shadows and depth on cards
- Gradient backgrounds on buttons
- Smooth color transitions on hover
- Professional spacing and typography
- Subtle animations (nothing jarring)
- Loading/transition states feel natural

DELIVERABLE:
Provide the complete HTML code in a single code block, ready to save as index.html and deploy immediately. The demo should feel like a polished product, not a prototype.

Include brief deployment instructions for GitHub Pages or Netlify Drop at the end.
